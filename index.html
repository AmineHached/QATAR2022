        <h5>Confederation of African Football</h5>
        <p>The Confederation of African Football, or CAF for short (French: Confédération Africaine de Football, Arabic: الاتحاد الأفريقي لكرة القدم, romanized: al-Ittiḥād al-Afrīqī li-Kurat al-Qadam), is the administrative and controlling body for association football, futsal and beach soccer in Africa. It was established on 8 February 1957 at the Grand Hotel[1] in Khartoum, Sudan[2] by the national football associations of Egypt, Ethiopia, South Africa and Sudan,[3] following formal discussions between the aforementioned associations at the FIFA Congress held on 7 June 1956 at Avenida Hotel in Lisbon, Portugal.

Its 41 member associations represent countries and territories mainly in North America, including the Caribbean and Central America, and, due to geopolitical reasons, three nations from the Guianas subregion of South America—Guyana, Suriname, and French Guiana (an overseas region of France).[3] The CONCACAF's primary functions are to organize competitions for national teams and clubs, and to conduct the World Cup and Women's World Cup qualifying tournaments.

        <h5>Asian Football Confederation</h5>
        <p>The Asian Football Confederation is the governing body of association football, beach soccer, and futsal in some countries/territories in Asia and Oceania. It has 47 member countries most of which are located in Asia. Australia, formerly in OFC, joined AFC in 2006. Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands, both territories of the United States, are also AFC members that are geographically in Oceania. The Asian Ladies Football Confederation (ALFC) was the section of AFC who managed women's association football in Asia. The group was independently founded in April 1968 in a meeting involving Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore. In 1986 ALFC merged with AFC.
