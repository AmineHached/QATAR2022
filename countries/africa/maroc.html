        <h1>Morroco</h1>
        <p>The flag of Morocco (Arabic: علم المغرب) is the flag used by the government of Morocco which served as the national flag of Morocco since 17 November 1915. It is a red field with a green star in the center. The green star represents the five pillars of Islam and the red represents the blood of the ancestors and unity.

          Red has considerable historic significance in Morocco, proclaiming the descent from royal 'Alawid dynasty. This ruling house was associated with the Islamic prophet Muhammad via Fatimah, the wife of Ali, the fourth Muslim Caliph. Red is also the color that was used by the sharifs of Mecca and the imams of Yemen. From the 17th century on, when Morocco was ruled by the 'Alawid dynasty, the flags of the country were plain red.

        <h2>Hakimi 2</h2>
        <h5>Achraf Hakimi</h5>
        <p>Achraf Hakimi Mouh (Arabic: أشرف حكيمي; born 4 November 1998) is a professional footballer who plays for Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and the Morocco national team. He mainly plays as a right-back. Known for his speed, runs and goal scoring ability, he is regarded as one of the best right-backs in world football.

          Hakimi came through Real Madrid's youth academy. He began playing for Real Madrid Castilla in 2016 and was promoted to the first-team in 2017, playing a few minutes with the latter. He was sent on a two-year loan deal to Bundesliga side Borussia Dortmund, winning the DFL-Supercup in 2019. After a successful loan with Dortmund, Hakimi signed with Serie A side Inter Milan for a reported fee of €40 million, with his performances helping the club win the league title, ending the club's eleven-year league title drought. His performances sparked the interest of several European clubs, with Paris Saint-Germain signing him in 2021 for a reported fee of €60 million.
          
          Born in Spain to parents from Morocco, Hakimi represented Morocco at various youth levels, before making his international debut in 2016 aged 17, after previously being capped by the nations' youth teams at under-20. He was chosen in Morocco's squads for the FIFA World Cup in 2018 and 2022, and the Africa Cup of Nations in 2019 and 2021.</p>

    <h2>Could Morocco win to fulfil Pele's prediction?</h2>
    <h3>In our series of letters from African journalists, Maher Mezahi looks at Africa's chances of winning the football World Cup, finally fulfilling Pele's prediction.</h3>
    
    <p>The world's biggest party took place at Education City stadium in Doha on Tuesday night when Morocco upset Spain in the 2022 Fifa World Cup round of 16.

      The vast majority of the 44,000-strong crowd was overwhelmed by emotion after Morocco defender Achraf Hakimi sealed victory with a cheeky panenka penalty kick.
      
      Moroccans poured out into the streets of Casablanca, Rabat, Marrakesh, and practically every capital city in Western Europe to celebrate.
      
      Even King Mohamed VI joined the jubilant crowds.
      
      After the team danced, hugged and cried in the dressing room, coach Walid Regragui made an extremely important declaration in his post-match press conference.
      
      "At some point in Africa, we have to be ambitious and why not win the World Cup, even if it's going to be hard," he said.
      
      The declaration was a sign of a paradigm shift in how African nations approach the World Cup, and it is fitting that it came from Regragui, who represents a paradigm-shift in African coaching.
      
      Not only did he cut his teeth on the continent, spending his formative years coaching domestic football in Morocco, he is also part of the inaugural Caf Pro Licence class of 2018 - the very first group of coaches who secured football's highest coaching diploma entirely on the continent.
      
      He represents everything that is right in African football: He's young, competent, cosmopolitan, fearless and a pan-Africanist at heart.</p>
