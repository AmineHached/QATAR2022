        <h1>Senegal</h1>
        <p>The Senegal national football team (French: Équipe de football du Senegal), nicknamed the Lions of Teranga, represents Senegal in international association football and is operated by the Senegalese Football Federation.

          One of Africa's most famous national football teams, Senegal reached the quarter-finals of the 2002 FIFA World Cup, becoming the second team from Africa (after Cameroon in 1990). They managed to upset defending world champions France, finish second in their group, and beat Sweden in extra time in the round of 16, before losing to Turkey in the quarter-finals.
          
          Senegal’s first appearance in the Africa Cup of Nations was in 1965, when they lost 1–0 to Ivory Coast for 4th place. They hosted the 1992 African Cup of Nations, where they made it to the quarter-finals, and won their first AFCON at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations, defeating Egypt in the final.

        <h2>Camara 7</h2>
        <h5>Henri Camara </h5>
        <p>Camara’s good form led to him signing for EPL side Wolverhampton Wanderers in the summer of 2003. Performing well at a below-average EPL side, the marksman was certain to be called up to the 2004 AFCON, and he was.

          He played all 4 of Senegal’s games, failing to score as The Lions reached the QFs in an otherwise average performance from player and team. Camara also scored 7 goals in 30 EPL games for Wolves, a decent return. Wolves’ relegation meant the striker jumped ship on a loan to Scottish giants Celtic in 2004/05, which went well.
          
          4 goals in 7 caps for Senegal in 2005 also illustrated a striker still in good form. The Celtic loan also led to 8 goals in 18 league appearances, which kept him in the national setup as well. Camara eventually found his way back to the EPL with a move to Wigan Athletic in the summer of 05.
          
          The marksman started exceptionally for a bottom-half side, scoring on a regular basis. Fit and firing, Camara was called up to Senegal’s 2006 AFCON squad as a vital member of the starting eleven.
          
          At the tournament, Camara started all 6 of his nation’s games as Senegal came 4th place, a valiant display from The Lions. The marksman was integral to his team’s progression at the tournament, scoring twice.
          
          The goals were the opening goal in 2-0-win versus Zimbabwe in the group and the winner in the 3-2 victory versus Guinea in the QFs. Camara’s last major international tournament was the 2008 AFCON.
          
          The striker played all 3 games as Senegal exited in the group stage, massively disappointing for a nation with such quality.
          
          Camara’s final tournament ended well on an individual level, as his 1 goal was the equaliser versus South Africa in the final group game. He retired from international football in October 2008, aged 31.
          
          A player with natural swagger on the pitch, Camara was quick and agile with the ability to finish with both feet. The marksman’s attacking position was sublime, and he possessed flair in abundance.
          
          A cult hero at Wolves, Camara is also an icon in Senegal , having scored in 4 major international tournaments during his international career.</p>

    <h2>Senegal under investigation ?</h2>
    <h3>Senegal under investigation for breaking FIFA World Cup rules ahead of England clash</h3>
    
    <p>Senegal booked a clash with England in the last-16 with a 2-1 victory over Ecuador on Tuesday, but prior to that game they broke a World Cup rule that Germany have also breached this tournament
      Senegal are set to land themselves in hot water with FIFA ahead of their World Cup last-16 match against England.

The African champions, who suffered the devastating blow of losing talisman Sadio Mane just before the tournament began, beat Ecuador 2-1 on Tuesday to secure runners-up spot in Group A.

Aliou Cisse's side were up against it in Qatar after losing their opening game 2-0 to the Netherlands, but they bounced back with a 3-1 victory over the hosts to set up the winner-takes-all clash against the South Americans, in a match which would feature three goals all scored by players based in England.
Watford's Ismaila Sarr coolly rolled his side ahead from the penalty spot having taken over spot-kick duties from Mane, then after Brighton midfielder Moises Caicedo equalised for Ecuador, Chelsea centre-back Kalidou Koulibaly picked an ideal time to score his first goal for his country to put his side back ahead.

Senegal eventually held on, and will now face England at the Al Bayt Stadium in Al Khor on Sunday evening.
However, prior to that game it was confirmed on Wednesday morning that the Senegalese FA face a FIFA probe for not complying with World Cup regulations prior to the Ecuador game.

One day before each of their matches it is mandatory for every team at the tournament to conduct a 'Matchday -1 Press Conference' in one of two press conference rooms at the World Cup's main media centre.

These have to be attended by the team's coach and a player from the squad, often the captain.
