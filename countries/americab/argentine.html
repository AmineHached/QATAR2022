        <h1>Argentina</h1>
        <p>The national flag of Argentina is a triband, composed of three equally wide horizontal bands coloured light blue and white. There are multiple interpretations on the reasons for those colors. The flag was created by Manuel Belgrano, in line with the creation of the Cockade of Argentina, and was first raised at the city of Rosario on February 27, 1812, during the Argentine War of Independence. The National Flag Memorial was later built on the site. The First Triumvirate did not approve the use of the flag, but the Asamblea del Año XIII allowed the use of the flag as a war flag. It was the Congress of Tucumán which finally designated it as the national flag, in 1816. A yellow Sun of May was added to the center in 1818.

        <h2>Maradona 10</h2>
        <h5>Diego Maradona</h5>
        <p>His talent was so awesome that it could bring people to tears, especially in his native Argentina or his second home of Naples.

          Diego Armando Maradona earned himself immortal status in Argentina by carrying the Albicelestes almost single-handedly to World Cup glory in 1986 and nearly repeating the feat four years later.
          
          He forever won the hearts of Neapolitans by leading Napoli to two Seria A titles during his seven-year love affair with the club, and he is regarded as a legend at Boca Juniors even though his two stints there came at the early and late stages of his career and were relatively brief.
          
          "El Diego" was a barrel-chested midget from the Buenos Aires ghetto whose dribbling skills, shooting ability and creative vision nearly defied belief.
          
          For many, he was the greatest footballer of them all, and he will forever remain so.</p>

    <h2>Messi and Argentina heading to Qatar with high hopes</h2>
    <h3>Bidding for their third title, Argentina and their iconic No10 will arrive at the upcoming FIFA World Cup as genuine contenders.</h3>
    
    <p>Lionel Scaloni’s side go into the world finals full of confidence after a long unbeaten run
      Last year’s Copa America win ended a lengthy trophy drought
      While Lionel Messi remains the figurehead, Argentina have evolved as a team
      Argentina will head to the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™ with expectations at their highest in years.
      
      The 2021 Copa America win, secured on Brazilian soil at the Estadio Maracana, fired the dreams of a country that has but one objective on its mind: lifting a third World Cup Trophy. With Lionel Messi still leading the way in what will be his fifth and, quite possibly, last world finals appearance, there are many reasons why La Albiceleste are contenders for the most prized piece of silverware in the game.
      
      Qualification turned out to be the most straightforward of tasks for Lionel Scaloni’s side, who continue to surprise. In winning 11 matches and drawing six, they collected 39 points to finish second only to Brazil and 11 points clear of third. Impressive as those statistics are, it was the manner in which those points were won and the continental title claimed last year that has the Argentinians dreaming once more of World Cup glory.
      
      Following the defeat to France at Russia 2018 and the departure of a breed that had come so close to making football history at Brazil 2014, the outlook looked gloomy for La Albiceleste. Not only were there doubts about the potential of the new generation of players that came into replace them, but several well-known coaches turned down the opportunity to take on such a high-pressure job.
      
      Claudio Tapia, the president of the Argentinian Football Association (AFA), eventually put his faith in the untested Lionel Scaloni, who had joined the coaching staff of previous incumbent Jorge Sampaoli in 2018. It has turned out to be an inspired choice. Four years on, Scaloni will take his team to Qatar with spirits high having put the disappointments of recent years behind them and overcome a psychological barrier in the process.
      
      With a settled line-up, the eternal leadership of Messi, a new breed that can do justice to the jersey, and Scaloni’s tactical acumen, Argentina have their sights set on World Cup number three.</p>
