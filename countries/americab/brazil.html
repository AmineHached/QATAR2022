        <h1>Brazil</h1>
        <p>The national flag of Brazil (Portuguese: bandeira do Brasil), is a blue disc depicting a starry sky (which includes the Southern Cross) spanned by a curved band inscribed with the national motto "Ordem e Progresso" ("Order and Progress"), within a yellow rhombus, on a green field. It was officially adopted on 19 November 1889 — four days after the Proclamation of the Republic, to replace the flag of the Empire of Brazil. The concept was the work of Raimundo Teixeira Mendes, with the collaboration of Miguel Lemos, Manuel Pereira Reis and Décio Villares.

        <h2>Pelé 10</h2>
        <h5>Pelé jersey</h5>
        <p>Arguments as to the greatest of all-time will rage on forever. However, in comparison with his rivals for the honour, we can surely say without doubt that Pelé was the most complete player that football has ever seen.

          He had the technical ability to beat players one-on-one, his eye for a pass has been praised by all those he partnered, his prowess in the air is legendary and there can, of course, be no argument over his ability to finish given his goal record.
          
          At the age of 17, Pelé became the youngest player to feature in a World Cup final in 1958. He scored on six occasions in the Sweden-based tournament, including a semi-final hat-trick and two more in the final.
          
          It was to be the first of three World Cup triumphs.
          
          In 1962, Garrincha would carry the mantle for his side as Pelé recovered from an injury suffered in the Group Stage. Brazil, though, were victorious once again. The 1966 tournament would not be so successful, with Pelé once more suffering from injury as Brazil suffered a first-round exit.
          
          Pelé was coerced into returning for a fourth tournament in 1970 and was part of one of the best attacking units ever compiled—alongside Jairzinho, Rivellino and Gérson.
          
          While Jairzinho top-scored, Pelé added four more to his World Cup tally and, of course, claimed his third winners medal. He remains Brazil's highest goalscorer of all-time with 77 goals in 92 appearances.
          
          This is all, of course, before we move on to his feats at club level. The King.</p>

    <h2>Croatia shock</h2>
    <h3>Tournament favorite Brazil out of World Cup after losing to Croatia on penalties.</h3>
    
    <p>the favorite to win this year’s World Cup, is out of Qatar 2022 after losing to Croatia on penalties 1-1 (4-2) in Friday’s dramatic quarterfinal.

      It had looked as though Neymar had won it for Brazil after he scored a stunning solo goal in extra-time – tying Pele’s international scoring record for the Seleção with his 77th goal – but Bruno Petković broke Brazilian hearts with a last-gasp equalizer to send the game to penalties.
      
      It was Croatia’s goalkeeper Dominik Livaković who was the hero yet again in the shootout, saving Rodrygo’s first effort before defender Marquinhos saw his attempt hit the post which sent Croatia through to the semifinals. Livaković also saved three penalties in his side’s victory against Japan in the previous round.
      
      “Definitely something special against the favorite,” Croatia defender Dejan Lovren told reporters after the match.
      
      “We said in the last half of the last 15 minutes, don’t stop believing. Everyone said that and we knew it. We knew we would come back no matter how hard it was in some moments.”
      
      It was dizzying end to another remarkable game in Qatar which took until extra-time to really get going.
      
      After it dazzling display against South Korea in the round of 16, Brazil was taken into the trenches by Croatia.</p>
